# The Odin Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

This project implements a Rock, Paper, Scissors game to be played in the web browser's console, based on [The Odin Project Foundations Course's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors#problem-solving-approach).

## Update:

This project was updated according to the lesson [Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors#assignment). The game now includes a basic UI instead of being played in console.

Differences from the earlier version include new buttons, basic styling and DOM manipulation done by Javascript.
